System-eye measures the Transfer Function of the system under test by means of comparison of reference signal and signal produced by sending the reference through system under test.

Audio Input connection:

Use external auido interface, input 1 - measurement mic, input 2 - reference signal. 
Select correct audio interface in Preferences;
Send the same reference signal to input 2 and to measured system (use some kind of split).

Turn use AutioDelay button to automatically find the delay between mic and reference. without proper delay the measurement will be incorrect.

System-eye is equipped with pink noise generator that can be used af reference signal.
